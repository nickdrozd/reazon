;;; Commentary:

;; Reazon is an implmentation of the miniKanren language for Emacs. It
;; provides an interface for writing and running relational programs.
;; That interface consists of the following macros:

;; * reazon-defrel
;; * reazon-run*
;; * reazon-run
;; * reazon-fresh
;; * reazon-conde
;; * reazon-conj
;; * reazon-disj
;; * reazon-project

;; Besides these, there is a single primitive goal, reazon-==.

;;; Code:

;; -- Configuration --

(defvar reazon-timeout nil
  "The maximum amount of time in seconds that a query can take.

If a query is interrupted, it will return any results it has
collected so far.

Consider let-binding this around your call to `reazon-run'
instead of setqing it.")

(defvar reazon-occurs-check t
  "Whether to run the `occurs' check during unification.
Circular queries are bad. It is possible to detect them, but it isn't
cheap. Setting the flag to nil grants the programmer faster queries in
exchange for assuming the responsibility of ensuring correctness on
their own.")

;; -- Variables --

;; Reazon variables need to be distinct from Lisp symbols. They are
;; implemented here as vectors.

(defun reazon--make-variable (name)
  "Create a unique variable from NAME."
  (vector name))

(defun reazon--variable-p (var)
  "Check whether VAR is a variable."
  (vector-or-char-table-p var))

;; -- Substitutions --

;; An ASSOCIATION is a cons pair whose car is a Reazon variable.

;; A SUBSTITUTION is a list of associations such that no variable is
;; associated more than once and no variable is associated to itself,
;; either directly or through a CYCLE.

;; A variable unassociated in a substitution is FRESH.

(defun reazon--walk (var sub)

(defconst reazon--false (gensym)
  "A symbol to indicate substitution failure.
In The Reasoned Schemer, several substitution-handling functions
return #f (false) in certain circumstances instead of a substitution
to indicate that the operation failed. In Emacs, false is nil, which
is also the empty list, which happens to be a substitution. To avoid
confusing these functions, we pick an arbitrary dummy symbol to
indicate substitution failure.")
